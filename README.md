# My neovim config
Includes multiple LSPs and easy extensibility

For installation, you first need to remove / back up your neovim config. That is usually located in `~/.config/nvim`. 
After you've backed up your config, you can `git clone` the repo into your neovim config directory.


That might look like this: `git clone https://github.com/Keterion/nvim_config ~/.config/nvim/`
